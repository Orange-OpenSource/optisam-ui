It's possible to allocate a metric to a product and an equipment. 

Notice that the metric is applied to all parent equipments till the upper equipment in the hierarchy given as last equipment of the metric and if the equipment is part of a vcenter, all equipments under the same vcenter will have the metric for the same product, and when the metric is modified, it impacts all the equipments under the vcenter. 

Only metrics with types oracle.nup.standard and oracle.processor.standard can be allocated. 

To allocate a metric to a product and an equipment, go first to equipment.
