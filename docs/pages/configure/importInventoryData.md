## Generic template importation

2. Click on "Data Management" 
3. Click on "Global Data" 

![select APM](../../img/configure/import1u.jpg){: .zoom}

### Upload the file

Click on "Upload File" : 

![select APM](../../img/configure/import2u.jpg){: .zoom}

1. Click on "Browse" to select the file that you want to upload
2. Check the box if you want to delete the current inventory data 
3. Click on "Submit"

![select APM](../../img/configure/import3.jpg){: .zoom}



After the file uploaded, it will be anlaysed. Once the analysis done, you will able to download the analysis report by clicking on the symbol circled in blue.

![select APM](../../img/configure/dataAnalysis.jpg){: .zoom}


In the report you will see if there are some mistakes in your file and they will be highlighted if applicable. Otherwise you can submit the file.

![select APM](../../img/configure/import4.jpg){: .zoom}

### Data processing

Once your file has appeared in the table, as shown above, it will be processed with NiFi (the NiFi flow is launched every 5 minutes) and separated in different files from the original file you have uploaded. In order to see the generated files, click on Data. For example, when you upload a file like the OFR Template (as you can see [here](../../managing/templateForApplications)), you will have all those files generated : 

![select APM](../../img/configure/import5u.jpg){: .zoom}

In this table, you can see if the records have been processed and how much have been processed.
